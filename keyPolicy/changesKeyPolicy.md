## Policy

#### A key that grants 24/7 access to the MakeICT Makerspace can be obtained, at the discretion of the Security Group, by members who meet the following criteria:

### `+` Getting a key
1. Participate in a New Member Orientation and be an active member in good standing with MakeICT and all of its programs.
2. `=` Become part of the community by ~~meeting people~~ __printing off__ and completing a [MemberKeyApplication](http://makeict.org/wiki/Template:MemberKeyApplication) __that includes the following:__ ~~.~~
	* `+` A few multiple-choice and short answer questions.
    * `=` ~~This application includes~~ 6 signature~~s~~ __fields to meet some members of our community__:
        * `=` 2 Board Members__, 2 Area Leads or Deputies, and 2 Active Keyed Members__ [Condensing to one line so that the final policy doesn't seem so messy.]
        * `-` ~~2 Area Leads [Moved to the line above]~~
        * `-` ~~2 Active Keyed Members [Moved two lines above]~~
	    * `+` [Moved from below] Each signature must be unique and signify signers are comfortable with you having a key to the space. [These bullets were moved because they should fall under the signature part of the [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing)]
	    * `+` [Moved from below] Be prepared to answer questions about yourself, you are going to make 6 friends with the signatures above.
	    * `+` [Moved from below] Signers reserve the right to ask you to stay around longer before signing your [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing).
        * `+` Signers who qualify for multiple signatures on the [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing) may only sign once. [This replaces the last two bullets from below]
    * `+` Some rules that you must adhere to.
    * `-` ~~__These signers will be signing a sheet to give you a key to one of their homes, they will act like it.__ [Removed because it seemed less professional. These members should already understand our keyed members duties.]~~
    * `-` ~~[Moved to above] Each signature must be unique and signify signers are comfortable with you having a key to the space.~~
    * `-` ~~[Moved to above] Be prepared to answer questions about yourself, you are going to make 6 friends with the signatures above.~~
    * `-` ~~[Moved to above] Signers reserve the right to ask you to stay around longer before signing your [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing).~~
    * `-` ~~[Moved to above] Security Officers cannot sign [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing)s.~~

3. Contact the [Security Team](http://makeict.org/wiki/Security_Team) and ~~present~~ __submit__ your [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing) to request a key (Easiest on a Maker Monday).
    * Security Officers will ask you questions to get acquainted with you, similar to when you get your signatures. [This is step 1 to using the form as an actual application instead of a piece of paper]

#### `+` Having a key
* `+` Each member who retains a key and access to the space must have a completed [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing) on file.

#### `+` Losing a key
* `=` A lost key must be reported immediately so that it can be deactivated. If the key is found later, it can be reactivated. __Replacement keys are $5.00.__
* A member may not loan their key to any other person; doing so may result in forfeiture of the key and/or the right to have a key to the ~~makerspace~~ __MakeICT Makerspace__.
* `-` ~~Keys are a privilege and may be revoked by security if necessary.~~
* `+` Keys are a privilege; any member of the Security Team may revoke a key, at any time, if necessary.

#### `+` Revoking a key
* `+` Any active Security Officer may deactivate a key of a member and must immediately notify the Lead Security Officer
* `+` The Lead Security Officer shall notify both the appropriate member and the Board of Directors of the reason by phone or E-mail within 24 hours.

#### `+` Regaining a key
* `+` If a member loses a key, they can request another one by filling out another [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing) and submitting it to the Board of Directors. 

### `+` Special cases
* `+` The Lead Security Officer can fill out a [Key Assignment Form](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXMnZuRzdLQS1qbGs/view?usp=sharing) to replace the [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing) form in the case that a member needs one and doesn't have one. [When someone already has a key, but doesn't have a [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing) on file.]

## `+` Forms
* `+` All changes to the [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing) or [Key Assignment Form](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXMnZuRzdLQS1qbGs/view?usp=sharing)s must be submitted to the board for approval.
* `+` [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing)s are to be printed out by the member requesting a key. [This is to try and prevent members from getting a [Key Application](https://drive.google.com/a/makeict.org/file/d/0BzgGWgLj8XOXSDl6eVdoZUc1dWc/view?usp=sharing) handed to them right after orientation by making them print it off themselves.]
